# ==============================================================================
# Reusable Board Definitions
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file defines "virtual boards" that reuse artifact sets from existing
# boards but with custom identity metadata (name, vendor, support level).
#
# Purpose
# -------
# Allows boards without dedicated build configurations to appear in the
# Armbian downloads interface with custom branding and filtered image sets.
#
# Use Cases
# ---------
# - OEM systems that use generic UEFI images (e.g., Minisforum MS-R1)
# - Hardware integrators with custom board branding
# - Hardware variants that share identical builds with different branding
# - System on Module (SoM) boards that use carrier board images
#
# How It Works
# ------------
# 1. Define a virtual board with its own identity (slug, name, vendor, support)
# 2. Specify which existing board's artifacts to reuse (uses field)
# 3. Optionally filter by branch and/or file extension
# 4. The JSON generator will create download entries for all matching images
#    from the base board, but with the virtual board's metadata
#
# Field Reference
# ---------------
# Required Fields:
#   board_slug      : Unique identifier for the virtual board (URL-friendly)
#   board_name      : Human-readable display name
#   board_vendor    : Vendor/company slug (must match Zoho Bigin company_slug)
#   board_support   : Support level - "conf", "csc", "wip", or "tvb"
#   uses            : Board slug to reuse artifacts from (e.g., "uefi-arm64")
#
# Optional Filters:
#   branch          : Only include images from this branch (e.g., "current")
#                     If omitted, all branches are included
#   file_extension  : Only include images with this extension (e.g., "img.xz")
#                     If omitted, all file types are included
#
# Support Levels:
#   conf            : Configured - basic support, community maintained
#   csc             : Community Supported - good community support
#   wip             : Work In Progress - under active development
#   tvb             : To Be Verified - not yet tested
#
# Common Base Boards:
#   uefi-arm64       : Generic UEFI ARM 64-bit images
#   uefi-x86         : Generic UEFI x86_64 images
#   uefi-loong64     : Generic UEFI LoongArch 64-bit images
#   uefi-riscv64     : Generic UEFI RISC-V 64-bit images
#
# Example 1: Simple OEM Board
# -------------------------
# Creates entries for all uefi-arm64 images with Minisforum branding:
#
#   - board_slug: "minisforum-msr1"
#     board_name: "Minisforum MS-R1"
#     board_vendor: "minisforum"
#     board_support: "conf"
#     uses: "uefi-arm64"
#
# Example 2: Filtered by Branch
# ---------------------------
# Only includes "current" branch images:
#
#   - board_slug: "khadasmind"
#     board_name: "Mind"
#     board_vendor: "khadas"
#     board_support: "conf"
#     uses: "uefi-x86"
#     branch: "current"
#
# Example 3: Filtered by Branch and Extension
# ---------------------------------------------
# Only includes "current" branch .img.xz files (no .qcow2, .zip, etc.):
#
#   - board_slug: "orangepi6-plus"
#     board_name: "Orangepi 6 Plus"
#     board_vendor: "xunlong"
#     board_support: "csc"
#     uses: "uefi-arm64"
#     branch: "current"
#     file_extension: "img.xz"
#
# Important Notes
# ---------------
# - The 'uses' board MUST exist in the actual build/firmware infrastructure
# - The board_vendor must match the company_slug in Zoho Bigin for company
#   enrichment (name, website, logo) to work correctly
# - Virtual boards inherit ALL image properties from the base board except:
#   * board_slug, board_name, board_vendor, board_support (overridden)
#   * REDI URLs (generated with virtual board slug)
#   * Company information (looked up via virtual board's vendor)
# - Platinum support tracking is independent per virtual board slug
# - Promotion status is evaluated independently for each virtual board
#
# File Extension Filter
# --------------------
# The file_extension filter matches against the FILE_EXTENSION field in the
# JSON output, which includes storage type prefixes. Examples:
#   - "img.xz"        : Matches standard compressed images
#   - "img.qcow2"     : Matches cloud images (QEMU/KVM format)
#   - "u-boot.rom.xz" : Matches U-Boot ROM artifacts
#   - "ufs.img.xz"    : Matches UFS filesystem images
#
# Testing
# -------
# After modifying this file, regenerate armbian-images.json and verify:
# 1. Virtual board appears in the JSON: jq '.assets[] | select(.board_slug=="minisforum-msr1")'
# 2. Correct number of images (filtering working)
# 3. Metadata is correct (name, vendor, company info)
# 4. REDI URLs point to the virtual board slug, not the base board
