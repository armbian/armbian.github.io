# Extensions Blacklist
# ------------------
# This file defines extensions that should be REMOVED from specific boards,
# overriding the auto-added extensions (like v4l2loopback-dkms, mesa-vpu for fast HDMI boards).
#
# Format: BOARD_NAME:branch1:branch2:...:REMOVE_EXTENSIONS="ext1,ext2"
#
# - BOARD_NAME: board identifier (must match BOARD in image-info.json)
# - branch1:branch2: optional, specific kernel branches (current, vendor, edge)
#   - If empty (::), applies to ALL branches for that board
# - REMOVE_EXTENSIONS: comma-separated list of extensions to remove
#
# Examples:
#   boardx:::REMOVE_EXTENSIONS="mesa-vpu"           # Remove mesa-vpu from all branches
#   boardy:current::REMOVE_EXTENSIONS="mesa-vpu"     # Remove only from current branch
#   boardz::vendor:edge:REMOVE_EXTENSIONS="ext1"     # Remove from vendor and edge only
